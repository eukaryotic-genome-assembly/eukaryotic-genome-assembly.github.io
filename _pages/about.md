### Marcela Uliano da Silva  

Marcela is a senior bioinformatician at the Tree of Life at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and an Associate Professor of Bioinformatics at Nord University. She studies whole genome architecture and composition across the Tree of Life in the context of genome evolution, species adaptation, conservation and invasive biology. Marcela also develops bioinformatics pipelines to yield high-quality genome assemblies. She is a co-chair of the Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee of the Earth Biogenome Project. 



### Jo√£o Gabriel Rodinho Nunes Ferreira

Hi there, I am a PhD student at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), working with genomics of the golden mussel, an invasive species that has been causing a lot of trouble for South American and Asian countries. In my masters I have studied the population genetics of the same species, genetically comparing golden mussels collected from 5 different states of Brazil. I'm passionate about genomes and their power as a tool to better understand the biology of any species. I hope we can exchange some experience and by the end of week you are confident enough to start taking advantage of the whole potential of PacBio and Hi-C data for assemblying great genomes!
