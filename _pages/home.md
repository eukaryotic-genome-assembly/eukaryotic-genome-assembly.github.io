Welcome to the [Physalia](https://www.physalia-courses.org/) November 2022 course run by Marcela Uliano & Jo√£o Ferreira.

Follow the links on the lefthand side to take part in the course modules.


This course will introduce the audience to a spectre of methods which are present in a usual assembly workflow, starting from raw data and finishing with a fully assembled genome. We will see how to manipulate raw reads, analyse their quality, how to run different assembly algorithms, how to run Hi-C scaffolding algorithms and how to analyse assembly quality.


I hope you have fun!
